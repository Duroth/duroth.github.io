<p>Years ago, during the Dark Age of Technology (no, not <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Technology">this one</a>), webbrowsers weren't the all-encompassing behemoths
they are today. They didn't need to be; websites were mostly static text, made up with some HTML, a splash of CSS, and,
if the website was truly fancy, a few lines of Javascript to provide that extra "wow" factor. This was the age before
browser-driven web apps, before the Web API, and before browser extensions.</p>

<p>Back then, when you wanted to expand or improve a website's (or the browser's) functionality, your only option was the
humble <strong>Bookmarklet</strong> - a small piece of Javascript code stored in the browser as a bookmark or favorite, that is run
in the context of the current page when you click it. Bookmarklets have been a feature of browsers for nearly 25 years now,
and even when browser extensions made them all but obsolete, bookmarklets haven't gone anywhere.</p>

<p>Today, with more and more technology being powered by web browsers every day - from games to Office applications
to graphics editors and everything in between - the bookmarklet might be due a strong comeback.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-bookmarklets%2C-and-how-do-you-use-them%3F">What are bookmarklets, and how do you use them?</h3>

<p>All (common) browsers support bookmarks, sometimes called <em>favorites</em>: Links to webpages, stored inside your browser, that you can
visit with a single click. They're a great way to remember your favorite or most used websites, but they have a second,
more or less hidden function - you can store scripts, instead of links, and these scripts are run inside the page you're
currently on, when you click the bookmark. These scripts are <em>usually</em> fairly short, but there's really no limit on what
these scripts can do. Or at least, there didn't use to be.</p>

<p>These 'special' bookmarks are called <strong>Bookmarklets</strong>, and they've been around for a long, <em>long</em> time. And although
they've seen their share of use in offices and business environments, bookmarklets have never been commonplace in the
outside world.</p>

<p>But why not? Bookmarklets are incredibly useful. And even though recent security features have closed off some of the
functionality that bigger bookmarklets relied on, the simple 'one-liners' continue to work across nearly all browsers
and devices.</p>

<p>Bookmarklets can help make your favorite sites even better, by adding missing functionality or improving what's already
there. While they can't magically create something from nothing, they can expose hidden information, or transform large
swaths of messy data into easily digestible chunks of information. And they're certainly not for developers only! If
you've ever been required to use specific websites, for any reason, chances are you've found something you wish simply
worked... <em>Better</em>.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer%3A-be-careful-who-and-what-you-trust%21">Disclaimer: Be careful who and what you trust!</h3>

<p>As we'll explore some bookmarklets that I've personally written or used, please keep in mind the following disclaimer.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklets, like all other scripts, can be malicious, and can be used to, for example, steal account details or
personal information. Remain cautious, and don't trust people blindly, especially when they claim to act solely in <em>your</em>
best interests. This also goes for everything you'll find in this article. ;)</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-bookmarklets">How to create bookmarklets</h3>

<p>Bookmarklets are created the same way as any bookmark, but might require a few more steps in some cases. Most browsers
have a "bookmark this site" button, but might not have a conventional "create bookmark" button, or may have it hidden
out of sight. In Chrome, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>D</code> to bookmark the current tab, and right-click it to edit the properties;</li>
<li>Click <code>‚ãÆ</code> ('More') > <code>Bookmarks</code> > <code>Bookmark Manager</code>.
Once there, click the top-rightmost <code>‚ãÆ</code> ('More') button > <code>Create bookmark</code> to create a blank bookmark.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short; the easiest option is to bookmark the current page, then edit the newly created bookmark, and edit both the
name and location (URL) of the bookmark.</p>

<p>Bookmarklets always start with <code>javascript:</code>, as opposed to <code>http:</code> or <code>https:</code> for regular bookmarks. After this comes
the full, valid javascript. So to create a bookmarklet, paste the script in the URL (location) field, and ensure it's
prefixed with <code>javascript:</code>.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="input-field-word-counter">Input field word counter</h4>

<p>Worried about hitting an invisible maximum character or word count when typing? The following bookmarklet shows the
word and character count for the input element you're currently typing in, or the text you currently have selected.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>javascript:!function(){var e,n=document.activeElement,t=document.getSelection();if(!n||"INPUT"!=n.nodeName&amp;&amp;"TEXTAREA"!=n.nodeName){if(!t.length)return;e=t}else e=n.value;var o=e.length,l=e.split(/\s+/).length;window.alert(`Word count: ${l}\nChar count: ${o}`)}();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Documented Source:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">(function(){
    var txt;
    var activeEl = document.activeElement; // Get the currently selected element on the page
    var selection = document.getSelection(); // Get the currently selected text on the page
    if (activeEl &amp;&amp; (activeEl.nodeName == 'INPUT' || activeEl.nodeName == 'TEXTAREA')) {
        txt = activeEl.value; // If the selected element is an input of some kind, grab its contents as the marked text
    } else if (selection.length) {
        txt = selection; // Otherwise, grab the selected text on the page
    } else {
        return; // If neither of the above apply, skip the rest of the function.
    }

    var clen = txt.length; // Character length: Number of individual characters in the string.
    var wlen = txt.split(/\s+/).length; // Word count: Approximated by splitting on whitespace and counting the items.

    window.alert(`Word count: ${wlen}\nChar count: ${clen}`); // Tell the values through an alert window.
})()
</code></pre>

<h4 id="password-visibility-toggle">Password visibility toggle</h4>

<p>A lot of websites and mobile browsers nowadays have a "show/hide password" button next to password fields that switches
between readable text and asterisks / dots. This bookmarklet mimics this functionality for sites where it's missing.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>javascript:!function(){var t=document.activeElement;t&amp;&amp;"INPUT"==t.nodeName&amp;&amp;("password"===t.type?(t.type="text",t.dataset.is_password=!0):t.dataset.is_password&amp;&amp;(t.type="password"))}();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Documented Source:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">(function(){
  var input = document.activeElement; // Get the currently selected element on the page
  if (!(input &amp;&amp; input.nodeName=='INPUT')) { return; } // Do nothing if it's not an input field

  if (input.type === 'password') { input.type = 'text'; input.dataset['is_password'] = true; } // Mark as 'text' and store the state;
  else if (input.dataset['is_password']) { input.type = 'password'; } // Or reset the field to 'password' type
})();
</code></pre>

<p>In light of this article, I've set up a small, curated bookmarklet library. It's public, and freely available to
everyone! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Duroth/bookmarklet-library/">Duroth/bookmarklet-library @ GitHub</a>.</p>
