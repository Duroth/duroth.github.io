    </header>

    <div>
        <p><img src="/build/img/photos/pexels-chrome.jpg" alt="Google Chrome on a mobile device" /></p>

<p>Years ago, during the Dark Age of Technology (no, not <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Technology">this one</a>), webbrowsers weren't the all-encompassing behemoths
they are today. They didn't need to be; websites were mostly static text, made up with some HTML, a splash of CSS, and,
if the website was truly fancy, a few lines of Javascript to provide that extra "wow" factor. This was the age before
browser-driven web apps, before the Web API, and before browser extensions.</p>

<p>Back then, when you wanted to expand or improve a website's (or the browser's) functionality, your only option was the
humble <strong>Bookmarklet</strong> - a small piece of Javascript code stored in the browser as a bookmark or favorite, that is run
in the context of the current page when you click it. Bookmarklets have been a feature of browsers for nearly 25 years now,
and even when browser extensions made them all but obsolete, bookmarklets haven't gone anywhere.</p>

<p>Today, with more and more technology being powered by web browsers every day - from games to Office applications
to graphics editors and everything in between - the bookmarklet might be due a strong comeback.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-bookmarklets%2C-and-how-do-you-use-them%3F">What are bookmarklets, and how do you use them?</h3>

<p>All (common) browsers support bookmarks, sometimes called <em>favorites</em>: Links to webpages, stored inside your browser, that you can
visit with a single click. They're a great way to remember your favorite or most used websites, but they have a second,
more or less hidden function - you can store scripts, instead of links, and these scripts are run inside the page you're
currently on, when you click the bookmark. These scripts are <em>usually</em> fairly short, but there's really no limit on what
these scripts can do. Or at least, there didn't use to be.</p>

<p>These 'special' bookmarks are called <strong>Bookmarklets</strong>, and they've been around for a long, <em>long</em> time. And although
they've seen their share of use in offices and business environments, bookmarklets have never been commonplace in the
outside world.</p>

<p>But why not? Bookmarklets are incredibly useful. And even though recent security features have closed off some of the
functionality that bigger bookmarklets relied on, the simple 'one-liners' continue to work across nearly all browsers
and devices.</p>

<p>Bookmarklets can help make your favorite sites even better, by adding missing functionality or improving what's already
there. While they can't magically create something from nothing, they can expose hidden information, or transform large
swaths of messy data into easily digestible chunks of information. And they're certainly not for developers only! If
you've ever been required to use specific websites, for any reason, chances are you've found something you wish simply
worked... <em>Better</em>.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer%3A-be-careful-who-and-what-you-trust%21">Disclaimer: Be careful who and what you trust!</h3>

<p>As we'll explore some bookmarklets that I've personally written or used, please keep in mind the following disclaimer.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklets, like all other scripts, can be malicious, and can be used to, for example, steal account details or
personal information. Remain cautious, and don't trust people blindly, especially when they claim to act solely in <em>your</em>
best interests. This also goes for everything you'll find in this article. ;)</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-bookmarklets">How to create bookmarklets</h3>

<p>Bookmarklets are created the same way as any bookmark, but might require a few more steps in some cases. Most browsers
have a "bookmark this site" button, but might not have a conventional "create bookmark" button, or may have it hidden
out of sight. In Chrome, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>D</code> to bookmark the current tab, and right-click it to edit the properties;</li>
<li>Click <code>‚ãÆ</code> ('More') > <code>Bookmarks</code> > <code>Bookmark Manager</code>.
Once there, click the top-rightmost <code>‚ãÆ</code> ('More') button > <code>Create bookmark</code> to create a blank bookmark.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short; the easiest option is to bookmark the current page, then edit the newly created bookmark, and edit both the
name and location (URL) of the bookmark.</p>

<p>Bookmarklets always start with <code>javascript:</code>, as opposed to <code>http:</code> or <code>https:</code> for regular bookmarks. After this comes
the full, valid javascript. So to create a bookmarklet, paste the script in the URL (location) field, and ensure it's
prefixed with <code>javascript:</code>.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="input-field-word-counter">Input field word counter</h4>

<p>Worried about hitting an invisible maximum character or word count when typing? The following bookmarklet shows the
word and character count for the input element you're currently typing in, or the text you currently have selected.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>javascript:!function(){var e,n=document.activeElement,t=document.getSelection();if(!n||"INPUT"!=n.nodeName&amp;&amp;"TEXTAREA"!=n.nodeName){if(!t.length)return;e=t}else e=n.value;var o=e.length,l=e.split(/\s+/).length;window.alert(`Word count: ${l}\nChar count: ${o}`)}();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Documented Source:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">(function(){
    var txt;
    var activeEl = document.activeElement; // Get the currently selected element on the page
    var selection = document.getSelection(); // Get the currently selected text on the page
    if (activeEl &amp;&amp; (activeEl.nodeName == 'INPUT' || activeEl.nodeName == 'TEXTAREA')) {
        txt = activeEl.value; // If the selected element is an input of some kind, grab its contents as the marked text
    } else if (selection.length) {
        txt = selection; // Otherwise, grab the selected text on the page
    } else {
        return; // If neither of the above apply, skip the rest of the function.
    }

    var clen = txt.length; // Character length: Number of individual characters in the string.
    var wlen = txt.split(/\s+/).length; // Word count: Approximated by splitting on whitespace and counting the items.

    window.alert(`Word count: ${wlen}\nChar count: ${clen}`); // Tell the values through an alert window.
})()
</code></pre>

<h4 id="password-visibility-toggle">Password visibility toggle</h4>

<p>A lot of websites and mobile browsers nowadays have a "show/hide password" button next to password fields that switches
between readable text and asterisks / dots. This bookmarklet mimics this functionality for sites where it's missing.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>javascript:!function(){var t=document.activeElement;t&amp;&amp;"INPUT"==t.nodeName&amp;&amp;("password"===t.type?(t.type="text",t.dataset.is_password=!0):t.dataset.is_password&amp;&amp;(t.type="password"))}();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Documented Source:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">(function(){
  var input = document.activeElement; // Get the currently selected element on the page
  if (!(input &amp;&amp; input.nodeName=='INPUT')) { return; } // Do nothing if it's not an input field

  if (input.type === 'password') { input.type = 'text'; input.dataset['is_password'] = true; } // Mark as 'text' and store the state;
  else if (input.dataset['is_password']) { input.type = 'password'; } // Or reset the field to 'password' type
})();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="my-bookmarklet-library">My bookmarklet library</h3>

<p>In light of this article, I've set up a small, curated bookmarklet library. It's public, and freely available to
everyone! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Duroth/bookmarklet-library/">Duroth/bookmarklet-library @ GitHub</a>.</p>

        <a href="/blog/2020/08/10/writing-a-simple-job-queue-in-redis"><h2>Writing a simple job queue in Redis</h2></a>
    </header>

    <div>
        <p><img src="/build/img/photos/pexels-queue.jpg" alt="People in a queue" /></p>

<p>At my job, most of our time is spent connecting to unwieldy SOAP APIs or writing clients for massive
legacy applications running on ancient software stacks. Running these tasks asynchronously would heavily cut down on
the time spent idly waiting for responses from one external server or another.</p>

<p>A job queue enables developers to offload some of the slower or more intensive routines in their application to an asynchronous
side channel. It would allow us to run these slow tasks asynchronously, which meant that the main process would only
run as long as the slowest step in the set, instead of the sum of all steps' execution times. On bigger workflows, this
could be as much as a ten-fold reduction in time spent idling!</p>

<h3 id="the-challenges">The Challenges</h3>

<p>If we were to implement a job queue, it had to meet specific requirements.</p>

<p>First of all, we wanted to stick to what
we knew. The cost of implementing a new tech stack is always a significant factor, even if the software itself is free.</p>

<p>Second, we wanted a fair amount of speed. Although we're not consistently handling millions of jobs on a daily basis,
large batch operations <em>do</em> happen, and our solution had to be fast enough to work through these in minutes - the faster
the better, obviously.</p>

<p>Jobs had to be handled atomically; no job should ever be handled twice. Some jobs would handle billing, or similar
volatile actions, and having these jobs run twice would be a costly mistake.</p>

<p>Finally, both Clients and Workers had to be relatively low tech. Some of our servers were running (and depending)
on outdated software, and simply couldn't be updated. We needed something that would run both on a Debian 7 server
using PHP 5.4, as well as Windows Server 2003.</p>

<p>Note that there was <strong>no</strong> requirement for a centralized 'task manager'. Individual clients were responsible for the
jobs they requested. If a job was not completed in reasonable time, the client could decide on an alternative course
of action. Message delivery would run on <strong>at-most-once</strong> semantics.</p>

<h4 id="enter-redis">Enter Redis</h4>

<p>We had already implemented <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> as both a caching layer and a session store. Even before the
introduction of Streams in Redis 5.0, it had all the tools needed to write a custom job queue:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lists</strong> keep a collection of elements sorted by order of insertion: This could be the 'queue' part of the equation.</li>
<li><strong>Hashes</strong> keep multiple field/value pairs per key, and can be used to store the job's metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Lua Scripting</strong> would help in implementing whatever features aren't yet native to Redis.</li>
<li>Redis supports <strong>Atomic</strong> Operations to ensure only one Worker will be assigned any individual job.</li>
<li>While Redis offers their own command-line client, you can connect through a simple TCP connection using any basic
utility, such as <strong>telnet</strong> or <strong>netcat</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having found our software solution, all remained was to write (and implement) our custom job queue protocol. Taking
inspiration from existing solutions, especially <a href="http://gearman.org/">Gearman</a>, the project took shape, and ultimately
released under the name <strong><a href="https://github.com/Duroth/gearmonkey">GearMonkey</a></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>

<p>Our job queue consists of three seperate components:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Client</strong>, or Producer, that creates the job and places it in the queue, and eventually recieves the output;</li>
<li>The <strong>Worker</strong>, or Consumer, that pulls a job from the queue, processes it, and generates said output;</li>
<li>The <strong>Server</strong> that acts as a message broker and links the Clients and Workers to eachother.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this article focuses on Redis exclusively, we'll use pseudo code for our examples. For more detailed examples,
check out the <a href="https://github.com/Duroth/gearmonkey">GearMonkey repository</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-server">The Server</h4>

<p><em>This article assumes you already know how to install and start a Redis server. If this is your first venture into Redis,
 I suggest reading their <a href="https://redis.io/topics/quickstart">Quick Start</a> guide before coming back here.</em></p>

<p>For the server, we'll use a standard Redis server. While a production-ready server probably needs an optimized
configuration file, a development server will work just fine under the default configuration.</p>

<p>When preparing a production environment, keep in mind that different use cases benefit from different configurations:
A caching instance doesn't need the same level of persistence that a job queue requires, and shouldn't care when 
individual cache items are incidentally cleared 'too early'.</p>

<p>For our job queue, we'll set the eviction policy to <strong>volatile-ttl</strong>. Our workers, when finishing a job, will tag on
an Expiry setting of 90,000 seconds (25 hours). This combination only garbage-collects finished jobs, and will attempt
to clear out the oldest jobs first.</p>

<h4 id="the-client">The Client</h4>

<p>The <strong>Client</strong> is the part of the Job Queue architecture that creates and enqueues jobs, and periodically checks
its status. Because our job queue does not have a 'smart' central message broker to monitor and re-queue
incomplete or failed jobs, that task lies with the individual clients. While this is not an ideal situation for most
"<em>Fire and Forget</em>" type message queues, our job queue primarily handles jobs that produce output important to the client.</p>

<p>In order to manage this, our Clients will keep track of created jobs in memory, and will periodically query Redis for
a change in status. Once the job status reaches the "success" state, or fails with an "error" state, the worker is
done with the job, and the output (if any) can be queried and used by the client.</p>

<p>In order to create, store, and enqueue a job, we use three (3) different Redis data types. We'll store the job data
in a <em>Hash</em> type, using the field/value sets for individual job parameters. the actual queue will be implemented as
a Redis <em>List</em>, where we have access to the Pop / Push commands. A simple <em>String</em> datatype will generate unique IDs
for our jobs by incrementing a numeric value.</p>

<p>When opening a new job request, our Client will perform the following actions, in order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a unique identifier for the job;</li>
<li>Set the job's metadata, including the default "idle" status, and the job's payload;</li>
<li>Enqueue the job;</li>
<li>Periodically query the job status, until the job is finished.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a job completes unsuccessfully (returns a status of "error"), or does not complete at all in a reasonable timeframe,
the client will handle the error as it sees fit. Jobs will not be automatically retried, but the client is free to
create a duplicate of the job to re-insert.</p>

<h4 id="the-worker">The Worker</h4>

<p>The <strong>Worker</strong> is the process responsible for handling incoming jobs. Workers can be started multiple times; the
atomicity of the Push / Pop commands in Redis prevents race conditions, and ensures that a job will be processed at
most once.</p>

<p>How a job is handled depends on the worker itself. If jobs require dynamic instructions, workers can parse the job's
payload for instructions. The complete GearMonkey specification introduces the concept of <em>Functions</em> that split queues
into more dedicated ones, as well as a basic <em>Priority</em> system. This article skips those features and focuses solely
on the basics.</p>

<p>In order to handle job requests, the Worker will perform the following actions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In a continuous loop, listen for available jobs;</li>
<li>Query the job data and extract the payload;</li>
<li>Perform the task(s) required to complete the job;</li>
<li>Write the response and a "success" or "error" status back to the job data.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>

<p>The following pseudocode is a minimalist implementation of both a Client and Worker process. Note that the Worker is
written as a standalone, dedicated process, while the client is made to be implemented in existing code. Also note
that both snippets assume an existing, valid connection to a Redis server. Finally, we'll use simple JSON strings for
input and output. This is personal preference; as long as your format of choice can be represented in a String, you can
adapt your clients and workers to use it.</p>

<h4 id="the-client">The Client</h4>

<pre><code class="plaintext">class client
    function send (var INPUT)
        // Create a unique (incrementing) identifier for the new job
        var ID = redis.call('INCR uid')
        // Create the job and assign values to the default properties
        redis.call('HMSET job:{ID} status "idle" input "{INPUT}"')
        // Push the job onto the queue
        redis.call('LPUSH queue {ID}')
        // Return the identifier; we need this to check up on the job later.
        return ID
    function recieve (var ID)
        var DATA = redis.call('HGETALL job:{ID}')
        return DATA

GREETER = new client
ID = GREETER.send('Jane Doe')
do
    sleep(1)
    JOB = greeter.recieve(ID)
    STATUS = JOB.status
    OUTPUT = JOB.output
while (STATUS not in "success","error")
write OUTPUT
 ==&gt; Hello, Jane Doe! How are you?
</code></pre>

<h4 id="the-worker">The Worker</h4>

<pre><code class="plaintext">class worker
    function listen ()
        // Ping the queue until a new job arrives; then pop it off the list.
        return redis.call('RPOP queue')
    function fetch (var ID)
        // Fetch all job data from the ID we've just recieved.
        return redis.call('HGETALL job:{ID}')
    function complete (var ID, var OUTPUT)
        // Update the job data with a new status and response message.
        redis.call('HMSET job:{ID} status "success" output "{OUTPUT}"

GREETER = new worker
loop
    ID = GREETER.listen()
    if ID not NULL
        JOB = GREETER.recieve(ID)
        OUTPUT = 'Hello, {JOB.input}! How are you?'
        GREETER.complete(ID, OUTPUT)
    else sleep(1)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Using Redis as a job queue is simple; it only uses a handful of commands, all of which available since at least version
3.0 (Current stable is 6.0 at the time of writing). It's fast also fast; Your standard developer's workstation
can handle up to 100,000 calls per second. And while most programming languages have Redis libraries available to them,
if yours doesn't, the underlying protocol runs on basic <a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol">TCP calls</a>.</p>

<p>While it may not be as feature rich as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or ZeroMQ, a custom job queue in Redis fills a niche
for developers looking to 'outsource' slow or demanding routines, without adopting a new and unknown addition to their
tech stacks. It enabled us to set up a small (yet very important) pool of microservices to offload some of our more
demanding algorithms to newer, more well-equipped servers, and run asynchronous calls to slow third-party webservices.</p>
